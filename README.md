### Eligibility to attend the end term exam: 

Average of the best 5 out of the first 7 weekly assessments (objective and programming) scores >= 40/100

Eligibility to get the course grade:

Attending the end semester exam AND

programming exam (OPPE) with a score >= 40/100

### OPPE
We are NOT going to have 2 OPPEs going forward. It is going to be ONE OPPE based on weeks 1-9.

Students have to mandatorily attend the OPPE on the first date.

-  If you fail in this, you get a chance to reappear the next weekend. So you get 2 chances to attempt the exam.
- If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to do it in the subsequent term.
- If you are absent on 06th Dec, you DON'T get another chance on 13th Dec..

NPPE [Syllabus Weeks 1-9]: (This will give you practice to handle the OPE, but not part of final course grade)

GAA = Average of score in Best 9 out of the 10 weekly graded assignments

BPTA: Average of the 4 BPT scores

QZ1 = score in Quiz I (0, if not attempted)

OPE = Score in online remote proctored programming exam

F = score in End Term exam

Final course score T = 0.10 GAA + 0.2 Qz1 + 0.3 OPE + 0.3 F + 0.1 BPTA
